    "body": "Clyde began making music as a teenager after discovering electronic music through sci-fi film scores and video game soundtracks. Gradually, his interests shifted towards IDM and music released on labels such as Warp Records and Ninja Tune. This love for electronic music continued to grow as he left Manchester for Leeds University and became immersed in local techno culture. Here, he was able to hone his production skills through a BSc in Music Technology before moving to London to study a Master's in Acoustics. Having released a number of tracks under different aliases pre-2015, Clyde's sound has developed into something unique, attempting to marry his passions for video game and sci-fi scores with techno and other electronic genres. His debut comes out on Sine Language Records in Summer 2018 with a remix included on Awe Kid's _Diode EP_."
